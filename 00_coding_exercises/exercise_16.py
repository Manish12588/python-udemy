Student Scores Report
You’re building a simple student report generator that combines names and scores.

Tasks:
Define a function generate_score_report that takes two lists — one with student names and one with their scores.
Use the zip() function to pair each student with their score.
Return a list of strings in the format "Name scored X marks"

student_names = ["Gargi", "Manish", "Rob", "Tom"]
student_scores = [70, 80, 90, 75]

for name, score in zip(student_names, student_scores):
    print(f"{name} scored {score} marks")
